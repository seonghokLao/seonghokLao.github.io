# Seong Hok Lao's page
## Intro
Hi, I'm Seong Hok, or Sean. I'm working towards a career where I can pursue my interests in Software Engineering.
I'm proficient in Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript. I have led a team of 5 to code a Tower Defense video game 
from scratch, as well as collaboratively developed a web application that serves as a tool for students to write better essays using AI.
## Projects
### [Essay Dashboard Web Application](https://ess-ai.herokuapp.com/)
[GitHub](https://github.com/jakob-bjorner/essay-dashboard)  
Ess-AI is a web application with a React.js-based frontend and Flask-based backend that serves to aid students in writing essays using AI.
I collaboratively developed the website with 5 other teammates and mainly did the following:
- Designed and implemented User Interface, routing, and light/dark theme
- Refined Python code for GPT-3 API to generate appropriate outputs
