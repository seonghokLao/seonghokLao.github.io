# Seong Hok Lao's Page
## Intro
Hi, I'm Seong Hok, or Sean. I'm working towards a career where I can pursue my interests in Software Engineering.
I'm proficient in Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript. I have led a team of 5 to code a Tower Defense video game 
from scratch, as well as collaboratively developed a web application that serves as a tool for students to write better essays using AI.  
This page will be constantly updated as I complete more projects.
